Reward Function

This is the file where the reward function can be customized. If you need more information than the provided please also change it in the environment.py file.

I made the reward function based on this data:
- FPS: 30
- Ticks/Steps per second: 100
- Episode time: 30 seconds
- Maximum number of ticks/steps: 3000
