# Carla Environment

This directory contains the code to configure the Carla environment for the Reinforcement Learning tasks.

## Instructions Manual

There are two ways of using the environment:

1. The first, and the recommended one is through the gym framework. An example of the main loop is as such:

    ```python
    import gymnasium as gym
    import src.env.environment

    env = gym.make('carla-rl-gym-v0')
    obs, info = env.reset()

    for i in range(300):
        action = env.action_space.sample()
        obs, reward, terminated, truncated, info = env.step(action)

        if terminated or truncated:
            observation, info = env.reset()

    env.close()
    ```

2. The second, is through the CarlaEnv class:

    ```python
    import gymnasium as gym
    from src.env.environment import CarlaEnv

    env = CarlaEnv()
    # ...
    ```

The environment's constructor has multiple arguments for the customization of the environment, these are:

- `continuous` (bool): Determines if the action space is continuous (True) or discrete (False);
- `scenarios` (list: Road/Roundabout,etc.): List of desired scenarios if you don't want to segmentate the scenarios JSON.
- `time_limit` (int): Maximum amount of seconds for each episode. When it reaches this timeout the episode gets truncated.
- `initialize_server` (bool): Automatically opens and closes the server. If False, you have to open the server side before running the client side scripts;
- `random_weather` (bool): If True loads a random weather configuration for each episode regardless of what's in the scenarios JSON. If False, simply loads what's in the JSON.
- `random_traffic` (bool): If True loads a random traffic configuration for each episode regardless of what's in the scenarios JSON. If False, it loads the traffic based on the scenario's name. It can be overwritten if given a seed to the reset function.
- `synchronous_mode` (bool): If True loads the client in synchronous mode. It is recommended to keep this as True, as some Carla features require it to be on.
- `show_sensor_data` (bool): If True, during each episode it opens up a pygame window with the ego vehicle's sensors for easy visualization.
- `has_traffic` (bool): If False, it loads the episodes without any traffic at all.
- `verbose` (bool): If True, it displays more detailed outputs about the episodes.

### Scenario customization

One of the main advantages of this framework is the ability to easily customize the training/testing scenarios. More information about scenario suite customization can be found in the [configuration documentation](../config/README.md). 

### Observation Space Customization

Observation space is totally customizable, and it follows the gymnasium.Spaces standard, however, if you wish to use the default ones, the observation space is:

```python
self.rgb_image_shape = (360, 640, 3)
self.lidar_point_cloud_shape = (500,4)
self.current_position_shape = (3,)
self.target_position_shape = (3,)
self.number_of_situations = 4

self.observation_space = spaces.Dict({
            'rgb_data':        spaces.Box(low=0, high=255, shape=self.rgb_image_shape, dtype=np.uint8),
            'lidar_data':      spaces.Box(low=-np.inf, high=np.inf, shape=self.lidar_point_cloud_shape, dtype=np.float32),
            'position':        spaces.Box(low=-np.inf, high=np.inf, shape=self.current_position_shape, dtype=np.float32),
            'target_position': spaces.Box(low=-np.inf, high=np.inf, shape=self.target_position_shape, dtype=np.float32),
            'situation':       spaces.Discrete(self.number_of_situations) # *
        })
```

\* The Situations are: 0: Road, 1: Roundabout, 2: Junction, 3: Tunnel
However you can customize this by changing the dictionary and the number of situations variable.

To  change the observation space you need to change the file [observation_action_space.py](../env/observation_action_space.py); and then go to the [CarlaEnv](../env/environment.py) class and change the `__update_observation` method.

### Action Space Customization

Observation space is totally customizable, and it follows the gymnasium.Spaces standard, however, if you wish to use the default ones, the observation space is:

```python!

# For continuous actions
# [Steering (-1.0, 1.0), Throttle/Brake (-1.0, 1.0)] <- [-1, 0] brake / [0, 1] throttle
self.action_space = spaces.Box(low=np.array([-1.0, -1.0]), high=np.array([1.0, 1.0]), dtype=np.float32)

# For discrete actions
# 0: Accelerate, 1: Deaccelerate, 2: Turn Left, 3: Turn Right
self.action_space = spaces.Discrete(4)
```

To  change the action space you need to change the file [observation_action_space.py](../env/observation_action_space.py).

### Reward Function Customization

The reward function is fully customizable. To finetune it you can simply change the function `calculate_reward` in the file [reward.py](../env/reward.py). If you want to change the signature of the function, in case you need additional data to calculate the reward, don't forget to also change it in the [CarlaEnv](../env/environment.py) class!

### Methods

The public methods accessible through the CarlaEnv class are:

#### Standard gym methods

- `env.reset()`: Starts a new episode in a random scenario.
  - seed: Seed to make the episode deterministic
  - options: Dictionary with the key `scenario_name` to specify the specific scenario to load in case the problem requires it.
- `env.step(action)`: Takes a step in the environment. The action must be according the action space.
- `env.render()`: Ticks the simulation
- `env.close()`: Closes the simulation

#### Episode methods

- `env.load_scenario(scenario_name, seed)`: Loads the scenario, at the moment the seed is mandatory.
- `env.clean_scenario()`: Cleans the scenario without changing map nor closing the simulation.
- `env.print_all_scenarios()`: Outputs the name of every scenario available.
- `env.load_world(map_name)`: Loads a map by its name. It does the same as the World module's set_active_map().

#### Debug methods

- `env.place_spectator_above_vehicle()`: It places the server screen on top of the ego vehicle.
- `env.output_all_waypoints(spacing)`: Outputs on the server screen all waypoints of the map separated by a determined spacing.
- `env.draw_waypoints(waypoint_list, life_time)`: Outputs on the server screen the waypoints present in the provided list.
- `env.get_path_waypoints(spacing)`: Returns a list of waypoints of the scenario path separated by a determined spacing.

## Attributes

The name of the scenario will be based on these attributes, then because there can be many there will be a counter after the name to differentiate.

Available Maps:

- Town01 <- small city roads with junctions with lightpoles
- Town02 <- Has city roads and junctions (neighborhood)
- Town03 <- Big city with roundabouts lightpoles, big junctions and inclined roads, also has big road and even a tunnel.
- Town04 <- Highway with small city in the center with lightpoles and junctions
- Town05 <- Highway with big city in the center with big junctions, lightpoles
- Town07 <- Village road with street signs and small intersections with lightpoles
- Town10HD <- Default map, big city with intersections, lightpoles
- Town15 <- This is the biggest city and it has every type of scenario possible, it’s used for testing the carla leaderboard challenge
Each map has a variation with the suffix “_opt”. This means that the map is layered and different layers can be removed and added with scripts. But these won't be used.

(Towns 11-13 make my machine crash, you can try them, i added compatibility to them but they still crash in my machine, beware)
